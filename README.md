This is a podcast app for Whatevery.co.

Right now, serves as a front end for The Whatevery Show, while podbean hosts RSS and files.

Some features of whatevery:

- New posts can process markdown
- Custom media player for episodes
- Can select different episodes to play on the media player. Defaults to most recent posted ep. 
- Optionally tweet with new/edited posts.
- Tweet length counter. TODO: add validation or failure. EG: if 160 chars are used, it should either fail or automatically truncate.


TODO: 

- make file upload possible for entirely self hosted podcast
- add RSS so podcatchers can pick up the feed
- add appropriate iTunes identifiers and metadata, such as iTunes author, desc, etc.
